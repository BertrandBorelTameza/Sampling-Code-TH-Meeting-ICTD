# Sampling-Code-TH-Meeting-ICTD
The R script "Sampling_Code" samples the respondents for the Town Hall (TH) meetings. The code simply calculates the distance between each household (HH) and each TH, then matches each HH to the nearest TH. This is done in the context of the Freetown Tax Reform Project. 
The "Graph_for_Report" script produces some interesting graphs using the powerful R libraries ggplot2 and bbplot in order to enrich the report.
